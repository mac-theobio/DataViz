## other logistical

- review old diary entries??
- (JD) integrate tips directory into page etc.

## lecture prep

* (JD) for scales lecture: https://www.formpl.us/blog/nominal-ordinal-interval-ratio-variable-example; check BB notes `private/diary.rmd`

## assignments

* good/bad data viz assignment (pref in repo ...)

## pipeline/structure issues

- import pipeline for rendering course outline locally (download `outline.docx`, render to HTML; see `mkoutline` in old repo)
- (JD) keep working on assignments structure?
- (JD) fix up `topics`

## low priority

- tsv format for schedule might drive me crazy
   - JD convert to paragraph + perl translation?
- (unavoidable, just complaining) scheduled meetings: don't like having a separate meeting space for each weekday but doesn't seem possible to create a single space with recurrence on different days *at different times* unless we do it in Outlook??? https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/32183026-teams-does-not-allow-me-setup-a-recurring-meeting?page=1&per_page=20
