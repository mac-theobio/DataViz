## other logistical

- should we explicitly let the students who are in India (GMT +5:30) off the hook for tomorrow's class (starting at 23:30 their time)?

## Teams

- scheduled meetings: don't like having a separate meeting space for each weekday but doesn't seem possible to create a single space with recurrence on different days *at different times* unless we do it in Outlook??? https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/32183026-teams-does-not-allow-me-setup-a-recurring-meeting?page=1&per_page=20

## pipeline/structure issues

- import pipeline for rendering course outline locally (download `outline.docx`, render to HTML; see `mkoutline` in old repo)
- how to structure assignments?
- table rendering is a little weird on the web (ovverruns right margin; looks OK on local_site??)
- how do I create slides/handouts, how do we link them?

## low priority

- tsv format for schedule might drive me crazy
