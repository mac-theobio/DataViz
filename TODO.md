## other logistical

- review old diary entries??

## lecture prep

- snarky Wordcloud tweet?
- https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/#do_something_else_entirely
- ethics/accessibility material ... https://mschermann.github.io/data_viz_reader/ethics.html; @cairo_ethical_2014, @cairo_if_2020; https://twitter.com/FrankElavsky/status/1396898372183855105

## pipeline/structure issues

- fix index/data pipeline issue to avoid too many commits
- fix pipeline to not mangle square brackets?
- import pipeline for rendering course outline locally (download `outline.docx`, render to HTML; see `mkoutline` in old repo)
- links/pointers to grading rubrics (i.e., meaning of 0-3; are these in the course outline?), details on project and presentation formats/expectations, etc.

## low priority

- (unavoidable, just complaining) scheduled meetings: don't like having a separate meeting space for each weekday but doesn't seem possible to create a single space with recurrence on different days *at different times* unless we do it in Outlook??? https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/32183026-teams-does-not-allow-me-setup-a-recurring-meeting?page=1&per_page=20
