## other logistical


- get R subdir integrated into workflow?
- review old diary entries??
- why does data link go in the opposite direction?
- is topics dir necessary?
- integrate tips directory into page etc.

## Teams

- scheduled meetings: don't like having a separate meeting space for each weekday but doesn't seem possible to create a single space with recurrence on different days *at different times* unless we do it in Outlook??? https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/32183026-teams-does-not-allow-me-setup-a-recurring-meeting?page=1&per_page=20

## pipeline/structure issues

- import pipeline for rendering course outline locally (download `outline.docx`, render to HTML; see `mkoutline` in old repo)
- how to structure assignments?

## low priority

- tsv format for schedule might drive me crazy
