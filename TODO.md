## other logistical

- post R script
- post recording link (maybe): https://mcmasteru365.sharepoint.com/sites/Section_2219-9263/Shared%20Documents/General/Recordings/General-20210908_133618-Meeting%20Recording.mp4?web=1
- archaeologize and post R resources/tips from QMEE
- diary entry (nuts and bolts, introductions, 2/3 of tidyverse material, BB live-coding in RStudio, request for Shiny)
- review old diary entries??


## Teams

- scheduled meetings: don't like having a separate meeting space for each weekday but doesn't seem possible to create a single space with recurrence on different days *at different times* unless we do it in Outlook??? https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public/suggestions/32183026-teams-does-not-allow-me-setup-a-recurring-meeting?page=1&per_page=20

## pipeline/structure issues

- import pipeline for rendering course outline locally (download `outline.docx`, render to HTML; see `mkoutline` in old repo)
- how to structure assignments?
- table rendering is a little weird on the web (overruns right margin; looks OK on local_site??)
- how do I create slides/handouts, how do we link them?

## low priority

- tsv format for schedule might drive me crazy
