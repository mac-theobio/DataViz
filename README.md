### Development rules

`make` rules:

- `syncup`: merge work, including rendered products, without doing unnecessary rendering
- `update_all`: remake the whole site
- `pushup`: remake the site; push main dir and all active subdirs (possibly with multiple commits)
- `local_site`: remake the site; open a local-file-based version in the browser
