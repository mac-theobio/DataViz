## Schedule

(under development)

```{r echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, results="asis", eval=TRUE}
library(huxtable)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(shellpipes)

mk_url <- function(x) {
  ifelse(nchar(trimws(x))==0,x,
         sprintf("[%s](https://mac-theobio.github.io/DataViz/%s.html)",
                 x,x))
}

silent <- (
	tsvRead(comment="#") ## Why does this work now?
	%>% hux()
	%>% print_html(max_width=1000) ## Why is print_html good? And why do refs work??
)

```
