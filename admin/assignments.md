## week 1

For Wednesday's class:

- make sure you have R (https://cloud.r-project.org/) and RStudio
(https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed. Please
make sure you have at least version 4.0 of R.
- set up a GitHub account (https://github.com) if you don't already have
one (see
https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/jennybc/happy-git-with-r/github-acct.html for
more information)

For Friday's class:

- watch the Rausher video listed on the main page
- read Sections 1-3 of Wilke's _Fundamentals of Data Visualization_
(https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/)
- read and follow chapters 1, 5, 7, 8, 10 of Happy Git with R (they're
short!)
   - create an (empty except for a `README` file) repository called
Stat744, and add `dushoff` and `bbolker` as collaborators
   - email us to let us know you have finished, and to tell us your
github username

## week 2

For Monday: 

- find an example (on the web, in a research paper, etc etc etc) of *either* a **great** (in your opinion) or a **terrible** (also in your opinion) data visualization. 
- write a explanation of a few sentences that explains what is good about it (e.g. interesting, engaging, funny, makes good use of Cleveland principles, makes a point clearly ...) or bad about it (is it ugly, bad, or wrong [see Wilke chapter 1]? [inaccessible](https://twitter.com/FrankElavsky/status/1396898372183855105)? how/why?)
- put a link to the example (you can upload images to your github repo) in the `README` file in your GH repository, and e-mail us that you've done so. (If you run into git trouble you can e-mail us the stuff instead, but putting it all in the repo is better.)

## General

For the first few weeks of the course, there will be a short assignment every week. These will be promulgated usually on Sunday, and you are advised to start before class on Monday. Assignments are technically due Friday at 16:30. This is to encourage you to finish quickly if you can, and move on with your life, not to give you pressure. 

If your assignment will be late, please email us by Friday at 16:30 to let us know when you will hand it in. This should be before 16:30 on Monday, unless we give permission for special circumstances.

**Submit your assignment by email** to [macdataviz@gmail.com](mailto:macdataviz@gmail.com). Your assignment is not done until you do this. 

<!-- Comment
    See QMEE/ assignments for more text that we will want to adapt when we give them R assignments.
