## Information processing

![](pix/ClevelandHierarchyR.png "Cleveland's hierarchy from best to worst: Position along a common scale e.g. scatter plot; Position on identical but nonaligned scales e.g. multiple scatter plots; Length e.g. bar chart; Angle & Slope (tie) e.g. pie chart; Area e.g. bubbles; Volume, density, and color saturation (tie) e.g. heatmap; Color hue e.g. newsmap "){width="80%"}

## Scales

* The top of the hierarchy involves putting things on scales

* But what scale do we use?
	* Are our data anchored to zero?
		* If so, are we interested in differences or ratios?
	* Are they anchored somewhere else?

# Anchors

## Anchors

* Anchors matter

* Your choice should be thoughtful and clear

# Area and volume

## Area and volume

* Where does area lie on Cleveland's scale?
	* It depends how you use it
	* Area can signal meaning

## Advertisement lessons

* Use area to indicate fair comparisons
	* On a physical scale

* Areas that can be compared linearly should be preferred 
	* Depends on importance of feature

* Avoid using (or hinting at) volume

# Other scales

## Other scales

* Log, log odds and log-ratio scales are often the most relevant
* We need to work to understand them well and communicate them clearly

## Physical quantities

* 1 is to 10 as 10 is to what?

* The __log scale__ is often good for concrete quantities:
	* When zero means zero
	* When we are thinking about things that might be added together
		* But _not_ when we actually want to add them together!

## Probabilities

* 1% is to 10% as 10% is to what?

* There is a simple, good answer
	* No single answer will always be best

## Example 

* 20% of the adult population is unvaccinated, but they account for 60% of clinical diagnoses

* How much greater is their risk?

## Odds ratios

* The _odds_ of an adult being unvaccinated is the ratio of the probabilities unvaccinated:vaccinated
	* 0.2/0.8 = 1/4

* The odds of a diagnosee being unvaccinated is 
	* 0.6/0.4 = 1.5
	* The odds _ratio_ is 6 â€“ that's the correct measure of relative risk
	* You can work this out the long way

* Odds are a natural basis for doing calculations with probabilities
	* These calculations are usually ratio-based

* Therefore: a good scale for many probability questions is the log-odds (or _logit_) scale

## Probabilities

* 1% is to 10% as 10% is to ...

* There is a simple, good answer
	* No single answer will always be best

* Odds scale: 1/99 is to 1/9 as 1/9 is to 11/9
	* Probability scale ... 55%
	* Has a concrete meaning, for example screening tests:
	* if 1% prevalence implies 10% of positives are true, then:
		* 10% prevalence implies 55% of positives are true

## Transformation lessons

* Transformations show valid alternative perspectives
	* Use human-friendly values when possible

* Different perspectives illuminate different questions

* Use visual clues to suggest whether your scales are additive
