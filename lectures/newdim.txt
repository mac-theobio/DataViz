## Data

We usually think of high-dimensional data as consisting of multiple _measures_ on a group of samples:

* Number of "reads" of different bacterial proteins from a set of soil samples
* Decathlon scores from different competitors
* Health measures from different children

## Types of measures

Many scientists traditionally think of high-dimensional data as having parallel, continuous measures:

* read matrices from soil samples

These may be complemented by a smaller number of “metadata” variables, which may be more diverse in type (count, categorical, etc.):

* environmental variables associated with soil samples

More and more datasets don't follow this:

* Canadian longitudinal study on aging has a huge number of variables per person with a wide mixture of types

## Duality

We study the rows (samples) using the columns (measures)

* What do the observed proteins tell us about the functional relationships between different soil samples?
* What does differential success in decathlon events tell us about the athletes?

But we can also do the opposite!

* What do measurements across soil samples tell us about the functional relationships between proteins?
* What does differential success of athletes tell us about the relationship between events?

## Heatmaps

	Value-based: better for seeing detail

	Correlation-based better for seeing groups

## PCA

A beautiful decomposition based on the idea that data points are points in a Euclidean space

* Need to think about scaling

We can think about the PCA as a decomposition (making observed points from idealized points)

* And relax it by requiring _non-negative_ combinations of _non-negative_ components (NMF)

Or we can think about it as minimizing distances:

* And relax it with non-Euclidean distances (PCoA)
* … or a rank-based approach (NMDS)

## Accurate dataviz

To what extent can we make visual distances reflect data distances?

* This is _not_ the default in most applications
